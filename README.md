This is my current homepage. I learned a brand new stack to make this and I'll be building upon it occasionally.

## The Stack 

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) A server-side rendering, smart bundling, route-prefetching React framework.
* [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) It has an amazing looking component library that's super intuitive to me. I love passing an array into component styles for viewport responsiveness--it's elegant.
* [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) A motion library for React that's also quite easy to use.
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com) A hosting platform for hobby sites with built-in CI/CD, autodeployment from GitHub, and analytics.
## Development

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```
